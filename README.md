VR Twitter World
========

A demo using Three.js to create a visualisation of real time tweets as particles.

If you make a really nice visualisation from this basic code, please do let me know! I'm on Twitter at @thatpatrickguy, or you can find me at http://www.patrickcatanzariti.com or http://www.patcat.com.

I love 3D visualisations...
